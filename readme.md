Technologies used:
JavaScript
Node.js
Express.js
Passport.js
MongoDB
Mongoose
Postman
Web API


Approach taken:

Models were created and user routes were the first thing to be worked on. After some testing on Postman, I began looking for a suitable web API to use. Ultimately, I know I will have to go back and began to work on my own to have it as I would truly like. I wanted the SongKick API but never got a response for an API key and couldn't wait much longer. I began to use the SeatGeek API, but after connecting to the API, the information returned was not sufficient. I ultimately landed on the Eventful API which returned a lot of information and is free.
